# electron_rotate
```
Implementing under Matlab

Display single electron circling under controlled electric potential.
Using difference equation get electric fields based on given electric potential.
Set initial condition to make electron cirle around the center of the window.
There are 50 electric field distribution under dynamic electric field. We will apply the best fit one after each movement of the electron.


run circle.m to generate .mat records file under ./potential to record electric force

run fix_circle.m to show electron circling under static electric field

run dynamic_circle to show electron circling under dynamic electric field
```
